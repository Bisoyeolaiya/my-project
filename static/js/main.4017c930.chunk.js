You will be quick to assume my parent works for the military but you guessed wrong. They are both Civilians. We were opportuned to live with the army officers in Ojo, Lagos Cantonment because my mum works with the Ministry of Defence(Education). As a senior officer she was entitled to the benefit of living in the Cantonment as well as other civillians who were also senior officers. Growing up around children with parents who were in the military was never intimidating as you will think because they were friendly and good neighbours. You can literally visit your neighbours house and not feel afraid of the military uniform men. Many of my neighbours had junior ranked soilders working for them at home. It was fun seeing them around because they never made it seemed scary to associate with. Childhood was interesting then i can remember after returning from school and finishing my assignment, my friends who lived next to our block residence would call me and my younger brother to play outside. We did everything small children you can imagine loves doing especially building small houses with sand and the drama moments.

Let's just say i was a quiet gentle one. That kind of girl that sits in the first three rows in class. I was a good student and hardly would cause any trouble in class. After Secondary School, I gained admission into Covenant University to study Management Information System. I initially wanted Engineering but later fell in love with MIS and gladly accepted it. University days was amazing. I loved every moment in school. Covenant University has a conducive learning environment. So yeah i never had issues being a good student.

As time went on i enjoyed the art and picked interest in knowing more about hair merchandise. After my obtaining my first degree, i continued selling hair during NYSC and afterwards decided to make a brand for myself. I registered the business, opened a business account, registered it with a reputable logistics company, built an ecommerce store and many other essentials.
